#Histogram in Java   
   
---
   
This is an implement of histogram in Java with visualization method.   
   
I manually offered two arrays in the program for testing. One is the value and the other one is the frequency relatively.(For the raw data I set, the range should be around (-4,24) if you want it look pretty.)   
   
Just enter the histogram's lower bound, upperbound and the size of each bin following the hints and you will get an ugly histogram. Don't hate me!
